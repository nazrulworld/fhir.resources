        In some cases, implementers might find that they do not have appropriate data for
        an element with minimum cardinality = 1. In this case, the element must be present,
        but unless the resource or a profile on it has made the actual value of the primitive
        data type mandatory, it is possible to provide an extension that explains why
        the primitive value is not present.
